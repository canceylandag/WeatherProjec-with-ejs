# Weather app practice with open weather api and ejs.

I have just tried to mix my knowledge about Express js, ejs templates and api's.Because of I intended to do this as backend practice, I didn't touch css so much.

There are two ways to use api key

1. You can create your own apikey.js file and export your api key to app.js file as:

	exports.apikey="---------------------";

2. In app.js file, you can delete line 3 and In line 28, you can put your own api key as string:

	const apiKey="----------------;
